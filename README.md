# Build a ML pipeline in Pyspark

# Project Description

In this project we will learn how to create machine learning pipelines using Python and Spark, free, open-source programs that you can download. We will learn how to load your dataset in Spark and learn how to perform basic cleaning techniques such as removing columns with high missing values and removing rows with missing values. We will then create a machine learning pipeline with a random forest regression model. We will use cross validation and parameter tuning to select the best model from the pipeline. Lastly, you will evaluate your modelâ€™s performance using various metrics.
